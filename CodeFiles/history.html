          <h2 class="intro-title">What is Origami?</h2>
          <p>Origami is a Japanese word meaning 'folding paper' that has been adopted into English and many other languages. The Japanese word origami and the English word paperfolding mean exactly the same thing. According to Chinese tradition paper was first invented by T'sai Lun, a senior court official working for the Chinese Emperor Yuan Hsing, in AD 105. His paper was made from fibres obtained from bark, rags and old fish nets and was intended to be used as a medium for writing on (though the Chinese also used other mediums, such as flattened bamboo strips, for this purpose).</p>
          <p>Since folding paper is such a natural thing to do, it is likely that paperfolding, in its broadest sense, is almost as old as paper itself, though this paperfolding was probably only of the kind that can be called 'everyday origami' where paper is folded for purely practical purposes such as creating simple containers or concealing the contents of a letter.</p>
          <p>Objects made of paper are ephemeral and the record we have of them at an early date relies largely on their chance survival or their mention or appearance in poetry, books, fabrics, drawings, prints and paintings. It is likely that many practical and recreational paperfolds are much older than the earliest evidence we have for their existence. Unfortunately, of course, we cannot know, even approximately, how much older they might actually be.</p>
          
          <h2 class="intro-subtitle">Exploratory & Model-Making Origami</h2>
          <p>Many people refer to themselves or others to be one of two groups, 'exploratory paperfolders' or 'model-makers.' The difference between them is the way in which they work. Exploratory paperfolding designers tend to be process-focused, seeking to let the properties of the paper control the way their designs arise, and often stressing elegance and innovation. To them, paper is folded to discover what folding paper will do. Model-making paperfolding designers tend to be result-focused, seeking to control the way the paper folds so that the desired result is achieved, and often stressing purity and realism. They have a tangible aim in view and wants to find out how to do it.</p>
          
          <h2 class="intro-subtitle">Modular Origami</h2>
          <p>Although its roots are known to go back to at least 1734, modular origami is largely a modern phenomenon. Modular origami is a paperfolding technique in which individual sheets of paper are folded into modules which are then combined to create an integrated assembly such as a ring or a polyhedral model. In modern times, the modular technique was quite independently invented first by Robert Neale in the USA (Robert Neale's Octahedron) and later by Mitsonobu Sonobe in Japan (the Sonobe module and cube). Since then many paperfolding designers have expanded the modular repertoire, some of whom have specialised in modular design to the virtual exclusion of any other kind of paperfolding design. Historically, modular designers have tended, by and large, to be exploratory paperfolders, though model-making designers are increasingly getting in on the act.</p>
          
          <h2 class="intro-subtitle">Influence of Mathematics</h2>
          <p>Origami is amenable to detailed mathematical analysis, both in terms of the relationships of different parts of the paper within the sheet (which, in the absence of cuts or stretching, remain fixed however the sheet is folded) and in the spatial relationships between points outside the sheet (which vary as folds are formed). As a result of an increasing understanding of these relationships model-making paperfolders have developed mathematical design tools that make it possible to create realistically proportioned designs which make highly efficient use of the paper (though they may not always be either easy or elegant to fold). Whether, in the long term, this development has a positive or a negative effect on the development of origami design remains to be seen.</p>

            <h3 class="event-title">AD 610 ~ Japanese Traditional Ceremonial Paperfolding</h3>
            <p>At first much of Japanese paperfolding was ceremonial in nature, largely concerned with 'tsutsumi' or 'noshi', which were wrappers used to contain and decorate gifts and offerings. This practise still survives in the design of some gift wrappings in Japan today. Gradually, this ceremonial type of paperfolding gave rise to a folk tradition of folding paper into simple representational and practical designs.</p>

            <p>The book Senbazuru Orikata (Folding 1000 Cranes) was published in 1797. It explains many ways to fold a group of connected cranes from a single sheet of paper which has been turned into an interconnected network of smaller squares by means of carefully placed slits. This type of paperfolding is sometimes called Rokoan style. It is not clear whether the Senzaburu Orikata is a collection of traditional designs or an explanation of the design work of one particular paperfolder.</p>

            <h3 class="event-title">1845 ~ Kayaragusa Collection</h3>
            <p>The Kayaragusa (aka the Kan No Mado or Window on Midwinter), a collection of origami design diagrams, was compiled in 1845 (though not published until 1961). This compilation contains a varied collection of important models. The collection also evidences the existence of a variety of traditional creative techniques that were in use, such as instructions for uncut designs, or cutting slits into the starting shape used, or use of the 'blow-up' technique (in which a hollow section of the design is inflated to form, for instance, the head or body of the subject).</p>

            <h3 class="event-title">1840s-1890s ~ Chinese & European Origami</h3>
            <p>Little is known about the Japanese folk origami tradition after 1845, as evidence is lacking or insufficient. It is not impossible that there were parallel paperfolding traditions in other areas such as China and Western Europe, but detailed evidence to support this assertion is lacking. To the extent that it existed, Chinese paperfolding may also have been largely ceremonial. Some evidence of a non-ceremonial Chinese tradition does exist, particularly the two geometric origami designs Lazy Susan and Verdi's Vase are almost certainly of Chinese origin.</p>
            <p>Evidence for a tradition of paperfolding in Western Europe is largely based around the folding of baptismal certificates, the work of Friedrich Froebel, and a few simple folds such as the Pajarita (Cocotte), the traditional dart, the Newspaper Hat (and the boat into which it can be turned). Charles Dodgson (Lewis Carrol) mentions such boats, together with paper pistols, several times in his letters. The popular Victorian/Edwardian parlour game known as Consequences also made use of folded paper.</p>

            <p>In 1896, 'The Strand' magazine reported that the illusionist David Devant had 'electrified the audience' at the Egyptian Hall (in London) with his displays of paperfolding. The technique used was 'Troublewit', in which a large sheet of stiff paper, which has been pre-creased into a geometric grid, is quickly manipulated into many remarkable forms. In the same year, the famous novelist Leo Tolstoy wrote an essay entitled 'What is art?' that mentions the traditional paperfold now known as the Flapping Bird, though whether this fold is actually of Japanese origin is open to some doubt. Wherever it comes from, the Flapping Bird is probably the earliest known example of an action model.</p>

            <h3 class="event-title">1911 ~ Akira Yoshizawa</h3>
            <p>On 14th March 1911, Akira Yoshizawa, often called Japan's most-gifted model-making paperfolder, was born. By the late 1950's, working largely alone, he had revolutionised origami design and folding techniques, particularly techniques where multiple points are created without needing to cut. He also created a huge number of new and highly realistic models of animals, insects, fish and birds. His emphasis on naturalistic realism led him to abandon the traditional technique of folding paper dry in favour of 'wet-folding' in which paper is first dampened and then moulded into soft-folds, the shape of which it retains as it dries. This in turn led him to fold largely 'in the air' (rather than on a surface) and influenced his invention of the terms 'mountain' and 'valley' folds. It is said that Yoshizawa's influence on origami cannot be over-estimated.</p>

            <h3 class="event-title">1945 ~ Gershon Legman</h3>
            <p>The real history of origami in the West begins with the end of Japanese political and cultural isolation in 1945. Up to that time information about things Japanese had been scarce and difficult to obtain. Now it was freely available, for those who cared to look hard enough. The American writer and researcher Gershon Legman spent his time folding origami designs remembered from his childhood while recovering from a broken ankle. This led him to research the subject in depth, and he eventually discovered the work of Akira Yoshizawa. In 1955 he arranged an exhibition of Yoshizawa's designs at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam.</p>

            <h3 class="event-title">1950s ~ Organizations Form</h3>
            <p>Rising interest in origami spurred the formation of origami clubs and organisations such as the Portfolio Society (later to metamorphose into the British Origami Society) and the Origami Centre of America (later to become Origami USA). Almost from the very first the members of these societies were concerned not only to discover as many traditional designs as possible but also to create their own original designs and to push the boundaries of what was possible in terms of subject-matter and technique.</p>

            <h3 class="event-title">1950s ~ Pure Origami</h3>
            <p>The early paperfolders in the west often discontued use of Japanese traditional parallel techniques in favour of pure origami, where cuts were largely anathema and using only a single sheet of paper (usually from a square). While this may originally have been based on misconceptions of tradtional paperfolding, pure origami still drove the search for innovative folding techniques, especially in the model-making origami field.</p>

            <h3 class="event-title">1970s-Present ~ West Origami Influence</h3>
            <p>Since the formation of the Western origami societies a huge number of original designs have been produced. Up until the late 1970's it was possible for an individual paperfolder to be familiar with almost every design of merit and to keep up to date with all the latest developments in design philosophy and technique. Since that time, however, the number of origami societies, and of active designers has increased enormously. Before the growth of interest in origami in the West, paperfolding in Japan was of a relatively lowly cultural status, being practised largely by mothers and their children. Even Akira Yoshizawa had difficulty getting his work recognised or published at first, except in women's magazines. Western interest, however, has provoked an origami renaissance in Japan, where paperfolding is now seen as an acceptable academic hobby and practised by many intellectuals and professionals.</p>
